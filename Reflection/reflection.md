# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 
#### Semantic elements make it easier to distinguish between the different types of data on the webpage by clearly outlining what information is presented and their importance. By creating this hierarchy, the most important keywords placed at the top can inform search engines what the page is about in order to lead viewers to the page. Semantic tags also ensure that the code is easy to read and by extension, maintain. The code can be changed with minimal confusion, even if a different person has to make changes to the page. Also, as the content is noticeably divided under the semantic elements, it is easier for those edited the page to change specific areas without altering the rest of the webpage. This also saves a lot of time. 


## Question 2 (150 words)
#### Presentation One:  (Image link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/15j_0bXFM8_U-MIwy-cwvJtjsSkMlecj-/view?usp=sharing) This is a grid presentation. The header, right on the top of the webpage, is in clear view of the reader and the centre-aligned title also makes it stand out more. The image at the centre of the grid draws further attention. However, this does not give as much importance to the text, which is placed on the side. This positioning of the text might make it a little inconvenient to read. It also gives too much space for the sources and images. 


#### Presentation Two: (Image link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFJs9lmSdkNWIoURJeBQ8UcPXsBtJEUM/view?usp=sharing) This is a column flow presentation. All aspects are centred in the middle. Information is organised quite well and in an easy to read manner and the readers view will be drawn towards the centre of the page. This insures that the page is not just one entire block of information but something that they can keep scrolling through depending on the size of the screen.
