          Jane Austen was an English novelist. Born on 16th December 1775 in the Hampshire village of Steventon, she was the seventh child and second daughter of Reverend George Austen, the village’s rector. 
          She began writing novels from a young age in bound notebooks and would often create parodies of traditional genres such as romantic fiction and historical writing. These notebooks containing novels, short stories, poems, and plays are now known as her Juvenilia. 
          In 1809, four years after her father died, Austen, her mother, and sister Cassandra, moved into her brother Edward’s cottage in the village of Chawton. Two years later her first novel, Sense and Sensibility, I after her brother Henry helped her negotiate with a publisher. Her subsequent novels, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, and Emma were very well-received. All of Austen’s novels were published anonymously.  
          In 1816, when she was 41, Austen became ill with what is now considered to be Addison’s disease. She died in Winchester on 18th July 1817. Her novels Persuasion and Northanger Abbey were published posthumously. Her brother Henry supervised the publication of the two novels and announced her authorship to the world.
